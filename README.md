# DevConnector

> Small social network developer connector app built with the MERN stack. This is part of my "MERN Stack Front To Back"

### Build ðŸ’»ðŸŽ®

# Install dependencies for server
```

npm install
```

# Install dependencies for client
```

npm run client-install
```

# Run the client & server with concurrently
```

npm run dev
```

# Run the Express server only
```

npm run server
```

# Run the React client only
```

npm run client
```

# Server runs on http://localhost:5000 and client on http://localhost:3000




You will need to create a keys_dev.js in the server config folder with

```
module.exports = {
  mongoURI: 'YOUR_OWN_MONGO_URI',
  secretOrKey: 'YOUR_OWN_SECRET'
};
```
